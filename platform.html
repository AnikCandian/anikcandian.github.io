				<h1>Our Platform</h1>
				<p>Our goal in the government is to greatly improve the life of the common man, and this has to be done by a comprehensive plan - a plan we have created in full. We kept it as concise and clear as possible for maximum transparency.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="plank">
			<dl>
				<dt>Economy</dt>
				<dd>- Reduce all tax brackets by 10%</dd>
				<dd>- Invest in local businesses making less than $1 000 000 revenue. When these businesses reach revenues above $1 000 000, sell off our investmests and use that money to fund the government.</dd>
				<dd>- Create more crown corporations to increase spending and obtain another source of revenue to keep taxes low</dd>
				<dd>- Overall, increase local spending to better the economy and lower taxes by keeping stakes in local businesses</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>
		<div class="plank">
			<dl>
				<dt>Healthcare</dt>
				<dd>- Make healthcare a federal responsibility</dd>
				<dd>- Allow hospitals and clinics to obtain more funding by a token fee no more than $15 (which will be covered by welfare if this cannot be afforded) and offering luxuries that do not affect quality of healthcare</dd>
				<dd>- Overall, keep an equal level of healthcare regardless of economic status nationwide while making it competitive and removing the bloat that adds to wait times</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>
		<div class="plank">
			<dl>
				<dt>Basic Needs</dt>
				<dd>- Make more apartments with a federal committee overseeing it and lending them out to people who do not have living arrangements and cannot afford a house as of yet. Those apartments will be cleared once someone purchases an apartment once they can afford it (which is mandatory for residents of these apartments).</dd>
				<dd>- Remove financial barriers for people to pursue education to make Canadians smarter.</dd>
				<dd>- Overall, help people who are in between a rock and a hard place, and empower the masses</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>
		<div class="plank">
			<dl>
				<dt>Climate Change</dt>
				<dd>- Ban single-use plastics within a year. Alternatives have been made and are in widespread usage.</dd>
				<dd>- Repeal carbon tax and evaluate the situation every 5 years. We're still too dependent on fossil fuels.</dd>
				<dd>- Require that current industries dealing with unclean energy use 75% of their profits to invest in nuclear, solar, and/or wind energy effectively, with punishments if this is circumvented in any way</dd>
				<dd>- Overall, try to make Canada more green while being realistic and trying not to harm the economy</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>
		<div class="plank">
			<dl>
				<dt>Governmental Reforms</dt>
				<dd>- Require Senate membership to be chosen by election, so the party in power cannot skew the Senate in their favour</dd>
				<dd>- Change Senate candidacy to favour those with expertise in economy, political sciences, or local industries. Expertise will be decided by how long they dealt with one of these fields or their educational level (at least a Master's). This will ensure the Senate is technocratic and will look through potential laws with actual expertise</dd>
				<dd>- Pass a rule requiring a re-election to take place in a riding if 40% of citizens in said riding if they are displeased with their MP. This will make politicians more accountable for their actions.</dd>
				<dd>- Try to compromise within reason with other parties if a bill is not to their liking. This will mean laws will be made much more efficiently, while keeping more people happy.</dd>
				<dd>- Overall, make the government more effective, active, and for the people</dd>
