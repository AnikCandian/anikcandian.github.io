<h1>A Trip to Nicaragua</h1>
<p><strong>Have you ever wanted to go to Nicaragua?</strong></p>
<p>This nation was probably not on the top of your mind, especially since Central America has other countries to offer, like Costa Rica or Mexico. Nicaragua offers mindblowing views, great hikes, and even volcano boarding! Today, I will be showing you my complete 4-day vacation plan to Nicaragua, with calculations and the like. Oh, and you will be able to calculate yours too. Bring your notebook and pencil for the ride!</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's worth mentioning that this travel guide was made with a friend coming along. I'll name him John Doe.</li>
<li>I will be using Canadian Dollars in this travel report.</li>
<li>The vacation at Nicaragua is 4 days long, BUT the total length of the trip is 8 days. 4 of the days is spent on flying, and waiting for the next plane ride to arrive.</li>
<li>Please check your national travel advisories before making this trip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 1: Transportation</h2>
<p>Because taking a cruise to central America is NOT an option, John Doe and I will be using the next best option to go to Nicaragua with: first-class seats on an airplane!</p>

<p>The layovers are a bit long, but they don't have to be tedious. In Denver, I booked a hotel (more information on that in the Accomodations section), and I have friends at Houston to kill time from the last layover. As for the return trip:</p>

<p>Going home will be much quicker. Again, the Houston - Chicago layover seems a wee too long, but the friends from earlier should still exist from earlier, right?</p>
<p>What about the math, I hear you ask.</p>
