				<h1>Our Leader Anik Chakraborty</h1>
				<p>A regular citizen just like you who wants change - change for the issues affecting Canadians, change the bloated government</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>In 2022, Anik Chakraborty had enough. The economy was in shambles, life was in shambles, and the government looked over it and worked on legislature that had nothing to do with it. For example, in November, in the midst of all of this suffering nation-wide, S-242 was being thought of by politicians, a bill regarding radiocommunications. Is this the priority of the government, watching our nation burn while using the taxes of our nation to fund their intellectual play?</p>
		<p>So, Anik Chakraborty decided to try to bring change. He created the Power Party, a party that aims to bring relevancy to the government and solve the issues afflicting Canadians the most. He wanted to fix the mess we call the Canadian political system.</p>
		<p>This has appeal across the nation. Within the last few weeks of this party being formed, 1 593 members have joined as of November 8th. We didn't advertise, but it spread through the word of mouth of citizens who are rightly worried about where Canada is going. The point is, many of us Canadians are fed up with what our elected representatives are doing, fooling around while we suffer. With the Power Party, that will be put to a swift end. The government will finally be for the people, as democracies should be.</p>
		<p>Anik Chakraborty is just another politically aware citizen, concerned about the government ignoring our issues as regular Canadians. You can be one too, and take matters in your own hands by <a href="join.html">joining</a>.</p>
