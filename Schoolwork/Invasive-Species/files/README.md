# Invasive Species in Canada: Asian Carps
**NOTE: This format is just for show. Real version will look much more disappointing** \
\
Like lots of parts of the world, Canada has its fair share of invasive species. Many of them already cause lots of damage to their ecosystems, but we will be focusing on one that has the potential to destroy the ecosystems of the Great Lakes. They are the Asian carps.
## How did they get here?

Asian carps hail from **Southern Russia and China**. They were involved in aquaculture cultivation for thousands of years in their regions. Like many fish, they were a popular fish to feast on and held a special significance in mythology. In the early 1970s, southern American aquaculture managers imported the Asian carp for biological control of organisms like algae, plants and snails in their ponds. Flooding since then in the southern parts of the USA allowed the species to flee the ponds and arrive at the Mississippi River’s drainage system via its branches. As with many other invasive species, they were void of natural predators in an ideal aquatic habitat. And spread throughout the drainage system. Within 20 years, they have reached as far north as the Illinois River and its branches. Now, some of them have leaked into the Great Lakes. 

## Why is this a bad thing?

I'm not a marine biologist, I dunno
