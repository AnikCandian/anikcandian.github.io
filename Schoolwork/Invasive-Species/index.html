	    <p class="subtitle">From left to right, top to bottom, the Asian carps shown are the Bighead, Black, Grass, and Silver carp respectively.</p>
	    
	    <p>The term "Asian carp" collectively refers to four carps. They are the Bighead, Black, Silver, and Grass carps. They are an invasive species in Canada, and they can destroy ecosystems in the Great Lakes if they establish a permanent population.</p> 
	    <h2>HOW</h2>
            <img src="foodchain.jpeg"></img>
	    <p class="subtitle">This is a food chain involving the Asian carp. The sun's energy is consumed by the phytoplankton via photosynthesis, which are then eaten by zooplankton, which are then eaten by Asian carps, which are then eaten by alligator gars.</p>

	    <p>The Asian carp has origins in major river systems in China and Russia, which include the Yangtze, Min, Amur, Pearl and Yellow rivers. Each of the Asian carps had a niche useful for cultivation. The grass carp controlled the vegetation of their area, the Black carp consumed harmful snails, and the Silver and Bighead carps helped reduce undesirable plankton. These rivers range from southern Russia to northern Vietnam with the Asian carp coming along. North American climates are similar to the climates found in these ranges, which would mean Asian carps would have no problem adapting here.</p>
	    <p>In the early 1970s, aquaculture managers in the southern USA imported the Asian carp for biological contorl of algae, plants, and snails in their ponds. Flooding events occurring after the importation in the southern USA allowed the Asian carp to enter the Mississippi River system from its tributaries. The Mississippi River is an ideal aquatic habitat and is free from any predators the Asian carp would be affected from, which contributed to the Asian carps' spread throughout the river system. In the span of twenty years, they have reached the Illinois River and its tributaries. Now, most of the Asian carps threaten the Canadian Great Lakes. Some have managed to infiltrate it.</p>
	    <h2>WHY</h2>
	    <p>Silver and Bighead carps have been outcompeting native fish in the Mississippi River and area. Being able to consume 5 to 20 percent of their body weight daily, they leave far less microscopic plant and animal life (like phytoplankton and zooplankton) to support other fish.</p>
	    <p>Grass carp, which have been found in the Great Lakes unlike the other two, mainly consume aquatic plants. The destruction of aquatic vegetation could leave juvenile fish without cover from predators, as well as reducing possible habitats for spawning. The foraging required in the process could disturbb lake and river bottoms, as well as potentially destroying valuable wetlands. Foraging also makes the water more murky, making it harder for other fish to find food.</p>
	    <p>Additionally, Asian carps are prolific breeders. In areas where they have dominated habitats, they make up to 80 percent of the biomass. This also lowers the biodiversity of the area, which makes the ecosystem much more vulnerable.</p>
	    <p>Bioaccumulation may be affected by the Asian carp, because of its prominence in the food chain. This is especially true in places where they weren't native to but  were introduced. Other than decomposition, Asian carps are ridden of by consumption from humans. Anything they have bioaccumulated will inevitably be spread to us humans, which may bring illnesses.</p>
	    <p>If the Silver and Bighead carps reach the Great Lakes and establish a foothold there, they would have a huge impact on the activities and industries that occur there. Fishing, recreational boating, wildlife observation, and beach and lakefront usage would experience a detrimental impact.</p>
	    <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
	    <img src="Figure1.jpg"></img>
	    <p class="subtitle">This figure shows monitoring in the Great Lakes. We use this to collect information about the Asian carp in the region</p>
	    <p>Three underwater electric barriers have been placed in the waterway connecting Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River Basin to prevent the Asian carps from entering the Great Lakes. The first electric barrier was formed of steel cables. The second and third barriers were formed of two sets of electric arrays. This prevention technique is called electrofishing. There are other techniques to block the spread of the Asian carps. One technique is using hoop nets, fyke nets, and trap nets. These three nets can be used to trap fishes inside mesh closures. Another method is using seine abgs. Seine bags are lengths of fine mesh that are pulled through water to encircle fish. The fish will move into the bag when it is pulled forward. Another method is gill nets. Gill nets are mesh with square openings. Fish are captured when they get stuck in the mesh. One last method is using bongo nets and larval light traps. These two traps are made out of fine mesh and are kind of used just like seine bags, but they trap Asian carp eggs instead.</p>
