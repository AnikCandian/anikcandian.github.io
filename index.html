      <h1>A Trip to Nicaragua</h1>
      <p><strong>Have you ever wanted to go to Nicaragua?</strong></p>
      <p>This nation was probably not on the top of your mind, especially since Central America has other countries
        to offer, like Costa Rica or Mexico.  Nicaragua offers mindblowing views, great hikes, and even volcano
        boarding! Today, I will be showing you my complete 4-day vacation plan to Nicaragua, with calculations and the
        like. Oh, and you will be able to calculate yours too. Bring your notebook and pencil for the ride!
