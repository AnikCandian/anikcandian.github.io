      <h1>A Trip to Nicaragua</h1>
      <p><strong>Have you ever wanted to go to</strong> Nicaragua?</p>
      <p>This nation was probably not on the top of your mind, especially since Central America has other countries
        to offer, like Costa Rica or Mexico.  Nicaragua offers mindblowing views, great hikes, and even volcano
        boarding! Today, I'll be running down a complete trip plan. Oh, and there will be calculations. Bring your
        notebook and pencil for the ride too.
